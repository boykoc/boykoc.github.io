  <p>Hi, I'm Cody. I'm a developer.</p>
  <p>I have a great job digitizing a small portion of the Ontario Government.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I take on side projects (Web Development, Application Development, Graphic Design).</p>
  <p>I try to implement an agile, user-focused, iterative (AUI? pronounced A-oooo-y ?) approach to my work.</p>
  <p>Feel free to reach out via email <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> or on twitter {% include icon-twitter.html username=site.twitter_username %}.</p>
