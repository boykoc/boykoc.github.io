  <p>Hi, I'm Cody. I'm a developer.</p>
  <p>I have a great job digitizing a small portion of the Ontario Government.</p>
  <p>I feel the user is important, I always try to put them first when making an application.</p>
  <p>I enjoy coding, its like playing with digital lego; building things up and tearing them down. I'm always looking to improve my skills and learn new things.</p>
  <p>Feel free to reach out via email <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> or on twitter {% include icon-twitter.html username=site.twitter_username %}.</p>
