## Overview

This is my own cheat sheet for Windows Terminal. These are a few common commands that for some reason I have not committed to muscle memory.
Maybe the key combo's aren't quite right for me?

## Commands

* `Alt` + `+` -> split pane virtically
* `Alt` +  `-` -> split pane horizonally
* `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `up arrow` -> scrollup in active pain

* Resizing panes and jumping pane I can remember.

## Why Windows Terminal?

Like many, my work setup more or less depends on Windows. It's what's issued, what is used for email, etc. From there I jump to Linux and tried a veriety of options but since finding this I've been pretty satisfied.
