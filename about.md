Hi, my name is Cody. I'm a web developer.

I have a great job digitizing a small portion of the Ontario Governement.

Sometimes I take on side project (Web Development, Application Development, Graphic Design).

I try to implement an agile, user-focused, iterative approuch to my work (AUI? pronounced A-oooo-y ?).
