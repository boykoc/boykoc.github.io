Hi, I'm Cody. I'm a developer.

I have a great job digitizing a small portion of the Ontario Government.

Sometimes I take on side projects (Web Development, Application Development, Graphic Design).

I try to implement an agile, user-focused, iterative (AUI? pronounced A-oooo-y ?) approach to my work.
